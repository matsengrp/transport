This folder has scripts for performing two ancillary analyses from the
Olson et al paper. The transport and loneliness calculations are all self-contained,
so you can look here to see a minimal version of the calcs.

* `analyses/spike-in-and-tree/make_iels_mouse_trees.py` This script calculates optimal
transport distances between the individual IEL mouse repertoires and generates
dendrograms from those distances.

* `analyses/spike-in-and-tree/run_flu_spike_ins_single_chain.py` This script runs the
loneliness calculations for the spike-in experiment.

* `analyses/spike-in-and-tree/run_flu_spike_ins_alice.py` This script sets up for
running ALICE on the spike-in experiment. 

* `analyses/spike-in-and-tree/plot_flu_spike_ins.py` This script plots the results of
the spike-in experiment.
